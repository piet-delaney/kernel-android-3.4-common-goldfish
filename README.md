kernel-android-3.4-common-goldfish
==================================

Android common kernel project from AOSP ported to "goldfish" x86 architecture.

At the moment of project creation only android_3.4 branch has been patched and tested to some extent.
I have another patchset for 3.3, and any further contribution is welcome.

The project has been created since some people may be interested in having an Android kernel for the common platforms
plus Android Emulator support, and google will not integrate any patch for goldfish until further notice.

I have only tested x86, but getting arm to work shouldn't be too difficult.
If you have the time to do that - go ahead, contribute - ditto for any other kernel version/number etc.


Any comments are welcome.
